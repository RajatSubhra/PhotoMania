# Description 
An android app that lets users post photos to ‘the cloud’ and lets users see any/all photos that have been posted. Users should be able to leave comments and like photos that have been posted. Imagine a simpler version of Instagram—but there is no concept of followers. A user can see all images.

* Web based real time database using FireBase DataBase
* User Authentication using FireBase Authentication
* Store Images to Cloud using FireBase Storage
* Android Fragments
